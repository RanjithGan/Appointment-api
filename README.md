# Appointment-api

In this project I have created an API using 
Django Rest framework . So , when patient makes an 
Appointment with a doctor on a day. 
That data will be stored in database using API POST.
but when a patient tries to make a duplicate 
appointment (means appointment with same doctor on
same day) The API raises an exception, prints
That the appointment is already exists.
